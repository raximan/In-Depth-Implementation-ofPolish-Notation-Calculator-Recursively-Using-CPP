# Polish Notation Calculator

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains a simple calculator that operates on expressions written in Polish Notation. In Polish Notation, operators are placed in front of the numbers, eliminating the need for operator precedence or parentheses.

## Example
For instance, the expression:
```
− ∗ + 5 2 − 7 1 4
```
is equivalent to the conventional expression:
```
(5 + 2) * (7 - 1) - 4
```
